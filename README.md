# Employee Directory

An application to view non senstive data for employees within a business.

As a business owner
I want to be able to see information about my employees
So that I can better understand the layout of my company.

Employees are listed on the landing page.

A user can sort the employees by age, name, email, occupation or location.

A user may also filter out employees based on the their occupation or location, whilst they are filtering they can also sort the lists from those results.

Besides sorting and filtering a user navigate to the search page and search for any detail they wish and return the results straight away.

Selecting an employee from the list will bring up an individuals card, with their profile picture and non sensitive data.
